        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
            Passionate and motivated individual with a strong foundation in coding, problem-solving, communication, and teamwork. I have hands-on experience with C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, App Development, and Arduino-based projects, and I further strengthened my technical expertise by completing a CDAC course. Through this journey, I gained proficiency in modern technologies and tools including web development, database management with MySQL and SQL Server, cloud computing concepts using AWS, and programming languages such as C++, C#, Java, JavaScript, and Python. I also possess foundational knowledge in data science and Machine Learning, enabling me to approach problems with a data-driven mindset.

        </p>

            In addition to teaching, I work on software development projects,
delivering impactful solutions while empowering others through teaching
and mentorship.
