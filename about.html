        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
            Passionate and motivated individual with a strong foundation
in coding, problem-solving, communication, and teamwork.
Having gained experience with C++, HTML, App Development and
Arduino-based projects, I further enhanced my skills by completing a
CDAC course and learned the latest technologies and tools such as
web development, database management, and languages like C++, C#,
Java, and JavaScript. As a trainer and facilitator, I am dedicated to
training students and professionals in technical subjects, sharing
knowledge, and fostering skill development.

        </p>
        <p>
            In addition to teaching, I work on software development projects,
delivering impactful solutions while empowering others through teaching
and mentorship.
